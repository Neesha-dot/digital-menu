Redesign the "Bomb Rolls & Bowls" landing page (Image 1) with these specific requirements:

CONTEXT:
- This is a STATIC digital menu (no ordering/cart functionality)
- Customers scan QR code and browse menu while waiting for waiter
- Purpose: Let customers decide their order BEFORE waiter arrives
- Menu should explain what each dish contains (many customers don't know)

CURRENT ISSUES TO FIX:
- Logo looks like "Sizzle & Spice" - we need "BOMB ROLLS & BOWLS" branding
- Button says "Start Ordering" but we want "VIEW MENU" or "EXPLORE MENU"
- Text says "Tap to experience culinary magic" - change to menu browsing context

DESIGN REQUIREMENTS:

1. LOGO & BRANDING:
   - Use the bomb logo from Image 4 (red circle with bomb icon)
   - Restaurant name: "BOMB ROLLS & BOWLS" (white bold text)
   - Tagline: "Explosive Flavors Await" or "Asian Fusion Delights"
   - Keep the red circular background but use Image 4's color scheme

2. MAIN CALL-TO-ACTION BUTTON:
   - Text: "EXPLORE OUR MENU 🍜" or "VIEW MENU 📖"
   - Make it large, prominent, white background with red text
   - Smooth hover effect with slight scale animation

3. SECONDARY TEXT (below button):
   - Replace "Tap to experience culinary magic" with:
   - "Browse dishes • Read descriptions • Order when ready"
   - Or: "Take your time exploring while you wait"

4. ADD FEATURE BADGES (3 small icons below secondary text):
   - Icon 1: 📋 "Detailed Descriptions"
   - Icon 2: 🌶️ "Spice Levels"
   - Icon 3: 🥜 "Allergen Info"
   - Display horizontally, small, subtle

5. COLOR SCHEME:
   - Background: Red gradient (like current but richer)
   - Primary text: White
   - Accent: Yellow/Gold (for highlights)
   - Button: White with red text

6. ANIMATIONS:
   - Logo: Gentle fade-in from top
   - Button: Pulse effect to draw attention
   - Background: Subtle food-related pattern (bowls, chopsticks) at 5% opacity

KEEP:
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Clean, uncluttered layout
- Professional look matching AIRAVATA TECHNOLOGIES standards

OUTPUT:
Complete HTML with embedded CSS and JavaScript in single file.
