=== IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH ===

Start simple, enhance gradually:

PHASE 1 (Core):
- Basic HTML structure
- Layout with Tailwind
- Static content
- Essential styling

PHASE 2 (Animations):
- CSS keyframe animations
- Entrance effects
- Hover states
- Transitions

PHASE 3 (Polish):
- Fine-tune timing
- Add easing functions
- Optimize performance
- Test responsiveness

=== SAMPLE CODE STRUCTURE ===

App.jsx outline:
```jsx
function App() {
  return (
    <div className="bg-cream min-h-screen">
      <CheckeredBorder position="top" />
      
      <main className="max-w-2xl mx-auto px-4 py-12 text-center">
        <Logo />
        <Tagline />
        <CTAButton />
        <SocialIcons />
        <ContactCard />
        <Rating />
      </main>
      
      <CheckeredBorder position="bottom" />
      <Footer />
    </div>
  );
}
```

=== CHECKERED BORDER PATTERN ===

CSS approach (no images):
```css
.checkered-border {
  height: 35px;
  background-image: 
    repeating-linear-gradient(
      90deg,
      #E63946 0px, #E63946 30px,
      #FFFFFF 30px, #FFFFFF 60px
    );
}
```

=== KEY FEATURES TO IMPLEMENT ===

✅ Animated logo entrance

- Parallax background (subtle)
- Ripple effect on button click
- Floating background particles (very subtle)

=== PERFORMANCE TARGETS ===

- First paint: < 1 second
- Interactive: < 2 seconds
- Smooth 60fps animations
- Small bundle size (< 500KB)
- Mobile-optimized

=== ACCESSIBILITY ===

- Semantic HTML tags
- Alt text for images
- ARIA labels where needed
- Keyboard navigation support
- Focus indicators visible

=== DELIVERABLES ===

Create a working React app with:
1. Clean component structure
2. CSS animations (keyframes)
3. Responsive layout (mobile-first)
4. Interactive elements (hover, click)
5. Professional appearance
6. Fast loading time

Focus on creating a polished, working product that showcases the brand identity with smooth animations and great user experience. Start with the essentials and enhance progressively.
